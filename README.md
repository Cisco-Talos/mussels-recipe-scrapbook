# mussels-recipe-scrapbook

The "scrapbook" is a Mussels cookbook to store and share an assortment of recipe and tool definitions not already included in public Mussels cookbooks.

Feel free to add your own recipe definitions to the scrapbook by submitting a pull request, so that others can reference them.
